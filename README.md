# Open-access-nmr-FIDs
A repository for open access of FIDs of organic molecules for teaching spectroscopy. 


# Purpose

During the global pandemic of COVID-19, many NMR users and technitians are unable to run spectra of standard compounds, leaving those who are teaching remotely in a difficult situation when it comes to teaching spectroscopy. The purpose of this repository is to gather - curate - and dissmeninate spectra of simple organic molecules with the express purpose of using them to teach NMR spectroscopy - from FID to structure. 

# Submitting your data

Data submission is open to anyone. Please email teaching.nmr.spectra@gmail.com with the following: 

The FID files (clearly labeled please)
The Compound Structure
The type of data it is (Bruker, Varain, Jeol)
Solvent/Temperature conditions

# Use of these data

These data are OPEN and ACCESSABLE to anyone who wishes to use them for the expressed purpose of teaching NMR spectroscopy. These data are NOT to be used for research purposes, machine learning training, or other purposes not related to the education and practical training of NMR spectroscopy. 

# Acknowledgements

This project is a side project for me, and is not in any way related to my primary research. Beyond that, the utility is to be community built. All users who submit spectra will be acknowledged in the repository and any publications of this resource - or citing this resource - must cite ALL authors whose data appear in this repository.
